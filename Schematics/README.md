# Schematic 

Schematics were created in KiCad using standard libraries. A readable pdf copy is located **[here](https://github.com/Kayto/RAMBOard-2_C/raw/main/Schematics/RAMBOard%202_C%20Schematic_v1.pdf)**.

There are a number of unpopulated through hole jumpers provided on the board which are not required for the standard operation of the board.  Some of these could be used to provide HIGH and LOW signals, switch activation of the board and adjust the memory addressing.

I see some opportunities for future development.

# PCB Layout
I made one mistake on the PCB traces - at solder jumper JP1 "1" and "2" needed to be preconfigured as closed - bridged by a trace. However a solder bridge will do. 
Overall the board size is a good fit but some reduction could be possible, in particular to clear the existing RAM position - i am just being picky now!
