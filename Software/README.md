## Software

### Background

This section is a work in progress and hopes to detail some examples of "drive code", ideally using the RAMBOard. It's not the best guide as I am really a novice programmer. My days with the C64 were mainly spent with some BASIC type-ins and lots of gaming. I only had a datasette then, so the 1541 is relatively new to me.

If you want to skip the below and see a more exciting example of "drive code" then look here. This example is not using extra drive RAM, so I imagine there is potential for improvement.

### Sources

I have provided a summary page with some useful information and links to guides, books and articles about drive coding. Some of the information is not maintained any more, so where it seems to be at risk of disappearing I have archived it here. Original credits and sources will be linked.

## Examples

Some examples are collated that I have been using and developing to specifically test the RAMBOard.
| Name  | Description |
|----------|:-------------|
| **[WHEREISMYRAM.bas](whereismyram.bas)** | This BASIC program runs through and checks 2K blocks of RAM. |
| **[1541RAMREAD.bas](1541RAMREAD.bas)** | This BASIC program list the contents of a particular area of drive ROM/RAM. Useful to check whether the code you want is actually there. |
