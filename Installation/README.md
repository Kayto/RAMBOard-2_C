## Installation

Installation showing Wire "C", "B" and "A" (top to bottom in Photo).

* "A" requires connection to A14 - 6502 - U3 - Pin 24
* "B" requires connecton to RAM-WE - 6522 - U6 - Pin 22
* As noted in the RAM IC section - as I am using SRAM, wire "C" could be removed altogether and a bodge wire added to the RAMBOard from "C" to the 5V through hole on the PCB. In my case I connected it to 6522 - U8 - Pin 20.

The PCB was built to minimise the height of PCB on the exiting ROM socket. Low profile headers were usedinstead of sockets on the PCB.

Note the tight clearance to the drive wheel!
